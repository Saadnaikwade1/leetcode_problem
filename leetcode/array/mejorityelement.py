# Great question ðŸ‘Œ Letâ€™s walk through the Boyerâ€“Moore Voting Algorithm step by step, using an example.

# The algorithmâ€™s idea:

# We keep one candidate for majority and a count.

# If the current number is the same as candidate â†’ increment count.

# Otherwise â†’ decrement count.

# If count reaches 0 â†’ pick new candidate.

# Because the majority element appears more than n/2 times, it will always survive this cancellation process.
